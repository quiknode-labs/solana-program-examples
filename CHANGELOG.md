All notable changes to this repository are documented here.

## [2026-09-04] - Options venue example

### Added

- `finance/options`: a fully collateralized, physically settled options venue,
  in Anchor v2, Anchor v1, and Quasar, with a Kani proof crate. A writer posts
  the whole obligation (the underlying for a call, the strike in the quote token
  for a put) and lists an option at a premium; a buyer pays the premium and becomes
  the holder; the holder may exercise before expiry; after expiry the writer
  reclaims the collateral. Eight instruction handlers (`initialize_market`,
  `write_option`, `buy_option`, `cancel_option`, `exercise_option`,
  `collect_proceeds`, `reclaim_collateral`, `collect_fees`). Every settlement
  amount is a product of two of the option's integers, so there is no division and
  no rounding in settlement; the venue's fee on each premium is the only floor.
  The market account keeps a ledger of what each vault owes, asserted against
  the vault balances after every transfer, and the proof crate walks every path
  through an option's life and shows the ledger returns to zero. No oracle: physical
  settlement moves the tokens themselves, so the program never has to know the
  price. Each option is one account, bought and exercised as a whole.
- The Anchor v2 copy joins the `--no-idl` list in `.github/workflows/anchor.yml`
  (anchor#4947: its `OptionKind` and `OptionStatus` enums reach the IDL) and the
  root Cargo workspace; the proof crate joins both matrices in
  `.github/workflows/kani.yml`.

## [2026-08-21] - Anchor v1 kept alongside Anchor v2

Anchor v1 is expected to stay on long-term support, and many deployed programs
will stay with it. Both versions of every Anchor example now ship, each built and
tested by its own CI job.

### Added

- Every one of the 55 Anchor examples gains a sibling `anchor-v1/` directory
  holding the example exactly as it stood before the v2 port, restored from
  `94abbea`, the last commit on `main` before that merge. 864 files. The 17
  third-party `.so` test fixtures are byte-identical to the ones already tracked
  under `anchor/`, so git stores one copy and the tree grows by ~2.3 MB of text.
- `.github/workflows/anchor-v1.yml` builds and tests them on Anchor 1.1.2,
  installed through avm. It is the workflow as it stood at `94abbea`, with
  project discovery changed to `find -type d -name "anchor-v1"`. The v2-only IDL
  workaround (`anchor#4947`, enum variants) is not carried over: that bug does not
  exist in 1.1.2, so v1 builds generate IDLs normally.

### Changed

- The `Anchor` workflow is now `Anchor v2`, so the two checks read as a pair. Its
  filename, triggers and `find -type d -name "anchor"` discovery are unchanged.
  Both workflows match a directory name exactly, so neither can ever see the
  other's projects.
- Both Anchor workflows install the CLI from crates.io (`cargo install anchor-cli
  --version <v> --locked`). The v1 job started out installing avm from the tip of
  anchor's `main` branch, which meant what CI installed drifted with whatever landed
  there; 1.1.2 is an ordinary published release, so it comes from the registry like
  2.0.0-rc.1 does.
- Both Anchor workflows now run weekly (v2 Mondays 03:00 UTC, v1 05:00 UTC). The
  analyze step has always treated a scheduled run as "build everything", but nothing
  declared a schedule, so that path had never executed. It is worth having because no
  Anchor project commits a `Cargo.lock` and Dependabot only covers the root workspace,
  so dependency drift in either tree is otherwise invisible until an unrelated pull
  request happens to touch it.
- The two workflows no longer report colliding check names. Both declared jobs called
  `changes`, `summary` and `build-and-test-group-N`; the v1 job names are now
  `changes (Anchor v1)`, `anchor-v1-group-N` and `summary (Anchor v1)`.
- Every Anchor example README now names the CLI its commands need, on both sides:
  `anchor/` pages say Anchor v2 and `anchor-v1/` pages say Anchor v1. A bare
  `anchor build` was unambiguous while the repository had one Anchor and is not
  any more. `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, which sit above both, show both.

### Note

- The `anchor-v1/` crates are not members of the root Cargo workspace and cannot
  be: they carry the same package names as their `anchor/` siblings. `cargo fmt`
  and `cargo clippy` therefore do not see them, and the Anchor v1 workflow is what
  keeps them honest. They also have no committed `Cargo.lock` (`.gitignore` ignores
  `**/*/Cargo.lock`), so their transitive dependencies resolve fresh on each run and
  can break without anyone touching the directory.

## [2026-08-16] - Every Anchor example on Anchor v2.0.0-rc.1

All 55 Anchor examples build and pass their tests on 2.0.0-rc.1 (304 tests),
and `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` are clean.

### Changed

- The remaining 39 Anchor examples, all of `tokens/`, `finance/` and
  `compression/`, now build against `anchor-lang` 2.0.0-rc.1, joining the
  `basics/` examples ported below. `.github/workflows/anchor.yml` installs
  2.0.0-rc.1, since `anchor build` under a v2 CLI will not build v1 programs.
- `docs/anchor-v2-migration.md` collects every difference the port ran into,
  ordered by how often it bites. The rules the compiler will not catch for you
  are called out: borrows held across CPIs, `Box`'s missing `cpi_handle_mut`
  forwarding, and hand-built read-only handles over a live data account.
- `has_one` is deprecated in v2 and this repository's `rust.yml` runs
  `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, so every one of the 161 uses across 66 files
  in the Anchor programs moves to the `address` constraint on the sibling field
  it named. The Quasar crates keep `has_one`, which is still current there.
- The seven `transfer-hook` examples supply their own entrypoint. v2's
  `#[program(interface, ...)]` generates a CPI client and no dispatch, so the
  program declared that way builds to a ~900-byte object with no `entrypoint`
  crate has no entrypoint symbol, while an executable `#[program]` limits
  byte, which the transfer-hook interface's eight-byte values cannot use. Each
  crate now builds with `no-entrypoint`, so anchor exports its dispatch as
  `__anchor_dispatch`, and `src/entrypoint.rs` maps the interface
  discriminators onto handlers before delegating.
- `tokens/pda-mint-authority` and `tokens/token-extensions/cpi-guard` build
  their PDA by hand (`create_account` plus `initialize_mint2` /
  `initialize_account3`). Both examples exist to show an account that is its own
  authority, and a v2 SPL `init` constraint cannot name the account being
  initialized.
- `finance/order-book` keeps its ~180 KB zero-copy critbit book zero-copy: v2's
  `Account<T>` derefs straight to `T`, so `load_init` / `load_mut` simply go
  away rather than the state converting to borsh.
- Tests that asserted on an Anchor error *name* now assert on the numeric custom
  code (the `#[error_code]` discriminant plus the default 6000 offset). v2 does
  not log variant names, so the old assertions could never match.

### Removed

- `tokens/token-extensions/nft-meta-data-pointer` no longer depends on
  `session-keys`. That crate is Anchor v1 only: its `Session` derive requires
  `Option<Account<'info, SessionToken>>`, and `SessionToken` is not `Pod`, so
  v2's zero-copy `Account<T>` cannot hold it either. The program reads the
  session-token account layout itself (`src/session.rs`), checking owner,
  discriminator and PDA, and spells out the `#[session_auth_or]` fallback in the
  handler, so the gasless-session lesson and its security warning both survive.

## [2026-08-13] - Anchor examples in `basics/` move to Anchor v2.0.0-rc.1

### Changed

- Every Anchor example under `basics/` now builds against `anchor-lang`
  2.0.0-rc.1. v2 is a ground-up rewrite rather than a version bump: the crate is
  `no_std` and built on pinocchio, so handlers take `&mut Context<T>`, the
  `<'info>` lifetime disappears from `#[derive(Accounts)]` structs and account
  wrappers, `Pubkey` becomes `Address`, `.to_account_info()` becomes
  `.cpi_handle_mut()` / `.cpi_handle()`, and `.key()` becomes `.address()`.
- `#[account]` is now zero-copy and requires a `Pod` layout. State holding
  `String` or `Vec` moves to `#[account(borsh)]` plus `BorshAccount<T>`
  (`account-data`, `close-account`, `favorites`, `realloc`, `pyth`); state that
  is already fixed-layout keeps the zero-copy default but must carry explicit
  padding (`program-derived-addresses`) and cannot use `bool`
  (`cross-program-invocation` uses `PodBool`).
- Instruction data is wincode-encoded rather than borsh. The `#[program]` macro
  expands to `wincode` paths, so every program crate takes a direct `wincode`
  dependency. `BorshConfig` keeps the wire format byte-identical to borsh, so
  the checked-in account layouts and the tests that decode them with borsh are
  unaffected.
- The only edit most LiteSVM tests needed: v2's `solana_program` compat shim has
  no `system_program` submodule (the real module is at the crate root and
  exposes `ID`, not `id()`) and no `pubkey::Pubkey` unless the `compat` feature
  is on (`anchor_lang::Address` is the same 32-byte type).

### Fixed

- Anchor programs that put an `Address` in serialized state pin
  `solana-address = ">=2.6, <2.7"`. anchor-lang 2.0.0-rc.1 is built against
  wincode 0.5, but solana-address 2.7 moved to wincode 0.6; with both in the
  graph, `Address`'s wincode impls belong to the version the `#[account(borsh)]`
  derive is not using, and every `SchemaRead` / `SchemaWrite` bound fails. This
  is the same class of split that the zeropod/quasar-lang pin below addresses.

## [2026-08-04] - Oracle readers reject prices from before a cluster restart

### Added

- The three oracle-priced finance examples (`finance/lending`, `finance/prop-amm`, `finance/perpetual-futures`, Anchor and Quasar variants) now reject an oracle price stamped at or before the `LastRestartSlot` sysvar's slot, with a dedicated error (`PricePredatesRestart` / `PRICE_PREDATES_RESTART`) and a test per variant. A cluster halt stops the slot count but not the wall clock, so after a restart a feed can pass a slot-measured staleness bound while its price is hours old; the market pauses valuation until the publisher posts again. quasar-lang ships no LastRestartSlot sysvar, so each Quasar variant declares the 8-byte layout in `src/last_restart.rs` and reads it via `sol_get_sysvar`.

### Fixed

- The three Quasar variants pin `zeropod = "=0.3.3"`: zeropod 0.3.4 moved to wincode 0.5 while quasar-lang's pinned rev stays on wincode 0.4, so any fresh resolve (these projects commit no lockfile) split the graph across two wincode versions and failed every `Pod*` trait bound.

## [2026-07-23] - Metadata examples on Quasar 0.1.0 (vendored quasar-metadata)

### Added

- `tokens/quasar-metadata`: a vendored copy of the `quasar-metadata` crate from blueshift-gg/quasar rev `623bb70f` (the last revision that shipped it), adapted to compile against the 0.1.0 `quasar-lang` API (`RentAccess` type parameter on `AccountInit::init`, `try_find_program_address` rename, `Seed` import from `quasar_lang::cpi`, `unsafe` `set_data_len`). Upstream removed the crate before 0.1.0 with no replacement; vendoring it lets the Metaplex-metadata examples ride the same release pin as everything else. Provenance and local changes are documented in the crate's README and CHANGELOG.

### Changed

- `tokens/token-minter`, `tokens/nft-minter`, and `tokens/nft-operations` now migrate to the 0.1.0-release pin (`be60fca`) like every other example, depending on the vendored crate via `quasar-metadata = { path = "../quasar-metadata" }`. This supersedes the previous day's "not migrated" limitation: all 53 Quasar examples are now on 0.1.0.
- `quasar.yml` drops the `legacy-metadata-examples` job and `.github/.ghaignore` is empty again — the whole matrix builds with the one 0.1.0 CLI.

## [2026-07-22] - Quasar 0.1.0

### Changed

- Migrated 50 of the 53 Quasar examples to the Quasar `0.1.0-release` line, pinned by rev (`be60fca`) because crates.io still hosts `0.0.0` placeholders for `quasar-lang`/`quasar-cli`. Per project: `quasar-lang`/`quasar-spl` repinned (the four previously floating examples — `basics/pyth` and the three `compression` examples — are now pinned too); `Quasar.toml` rewritten to the 0.1.0 schema (`[testing] command`, `[clients] targets`; the old `[toolchain]`/`testing.language`/`testing.rust`/`clients.languages` keys are hard errors in 0.1.0); the `idl-build` feature and `"lib"` crate-type added for the new IDL build; and tests fully rewritten from the direct QuasarSVM harness (`QuasarSvm::new().with_program(...)`, `include_bytes!`, `assert_success`) to the new `quasar-test` fixture harness (`#[quasar_test]`, `Wallet`/`Mint`/`TokenAccount` fixtures, `crate::cpi` instruction builders, `Outcome` assertions). The standalone `quasar-svm` git dev-dependency is gone — `quasar-test` pulls the published `quasar-svm 0.1.0` from crates.io — and generated-client path dev-dependencies were dropped in favor of `crate::cpi` (a path dev-dependency to a not-yet-generated crate now breaks the required `cargo generate-lockfile`).
- `quasar.yml` CI installs the 0.1.0 CLI (`--rev be60fca`), runs `cargo generate-lockfile` before `quasar build` (the 0.1.0 IDL step runs `cargo metadata --locked`), and builds the three unmigrated examples in a separate `legacy-metadata-examples` job with the pre-0.1.0 CLI.
- Compute-unit assertions were dropped from the migrated tests pending recalibration under 0.1.0 (correct values are unknowable until the suite first runs on the new line).

### Known limitations

- `tokens/token-minter`, `tokens/nft-minter`, and `tokens/nft-operations` stay on the pre-0.1.0 pins (quasar `623bb70` / quasar-svm `cb7565d`): they depend on `quasar-metadata`, which was removed upstream before 0.1.0 with no replacement. They are listed in `.github/.ghaignore` and built by the legacy CI job.

## [2026-07-11] - Discoverability and FAQ pass

### Fixed

- Quasar CI broke repo-wide when `quasar-svm`'s HEAD (`c63afd2`, "sbpf v3") moved to `solana-program-runtime` 4.1 / `solana-address` 2.6, which cannot co-resolve with the pinned `quasar-lang` rev `623bb70` (needs `solana-address` <2.6). Pinned `quasar-svm` to `cb7565d` (the last rev before the bump) in every Quasar example that pins `quasar-lang`, matching the pin `prop-amm` already carried. `basics/pyth` and the three `compression` Quasar examples float both dependencies and are left as-is.

### Added

- FAQ sections, written as the questions people actually ask, in the root README and every finance example's `anchor/` README.
- `llms.txt` at the repository root: a summary and link manifest for LLM crawlers and answer engines.
- `docs/example-readme-template.md`, the example-README template that `CONTRIBUTING.md` referenced but which did not exist. It documents the H1 convention and the definition-first opener.

### Changed

- Every finance example README now titles itself `# Solana <Example> (<Framework>)` (e.g. `# Solana Escrow (Anchor)`) and opens with a self-contained definition that names Solana, so each example page stands alone in search results.
- The root README states its toolchain currency explicitly (Anchor 1.1, LiteSVM, July 2026) with a pointer to this changelog.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` style rules now include the README H1 naming convention and the no-em-dash rule.

## [2026-07-10] - Failed fundraisers can be retired

### Added

- `token-fundraiser` (Anchor): a `close_fundraiser` instruction handler. The Fundraiser PDA is derived from the maker's key alone, so a failed raise used to lock its maker out of ever raising again. The maker can now retire a failed fundraiser (after the deadline, target missed, all contributions refunded), sweeping any direct vault donations to themselves and recovering both rent deposits, then initialize a fresh fundraiser. New error variant `RefundsOutstanding`.
- `token-fundraiser` (Anchor): tests for both contribution caps (`test_contribute_above_cap_fails`, `test_cumulative_contributions_above_cap_fail`) and for every branch of the close path (before deadline, target met, refunds outstanding, donation sweep, and close-then-raise-again).

## [2026-06-30] - Anchor 1.1.2

### Changed

- Upgraded every Anchor program from `anchor-lang`/`anchor-spl` `1.0.0` to the latest stable `1.1.2`, and bumped the Anchor CLI used by `anchor.yml` CI to match (`anchor-version: 1.1.2`).

### Fixed

- `anchor.yml` built no projects when `.ghaignore` was empty: `find … | grep -vE "$ignore_pattern"` treated the empty pattern as "match everything" and dropped the whole list, so the workflow passed without building anything. Guarded the filter (as `native.yml`, `pinocchio.yml` and `solana-asm.yml` already do).
- `vault-strategy` and `perpetual-futures` LiteSVM tests loaded their sibling mock program's `.so` with `include_bytes!`, which is evaluated at compile time. Anchor's IDL build compiles the tests before that sibling `.so` is built, so the build failed. They now read the sibling `.so` at runtime with `std::fs::read`, matching the existing `cross-program-invocation/hand` test.

## [2026-06-12] - Rust + LiteSVM tests everywhere

### Changed

- All native, Pinocchio, and ASM examples are now tested exclusively with Rust + LiteSVM. The web3.js v1 / solana-bankrun / ts-mocha TypeScript test suites (which duplicated existing Rust tests) were removed, along with their `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and `tsconfig.json` files and the `ts/` client directories.
- Rust tests now load the program binary from the workspace `target/deploy/` (built with `cargo build-sbf --manifest-path=./program/Cargo.toml`) instead of per-project `tests/fixtures` directories. Committed foreign-program fixtures (e.g. `mpl_token_metadata.so`) stay where they were.
- ASM examples standardized on `sbpf build`'s default `deploy/` output directory; their inline LiteSVM tests load from there.
- `tools/shank-and-codama` now generates a Rust client (`@codama/renderers-rust`) instead of a TypeScript one, wrapped in the `car-rental-service-client` crate, and its tests are Rust + LiteSVM under `program/tests/`.
- `transfer-hook/block-list` gained a Rust + LiteSVM lifecycle test (`program/tests/`) driving the program through its Codama-generated Rust SDK; the mocha/web3.js test was removed. Its `package.json` now only covers SDK generation.
- CI (`native.yml`, `pinocchio.yml`, `solana-asm.yml`) no longer installs Node/pnpm; it builds with `cargo build-sbf` (or `sbpf build`) and tests with `cargo test`.

### Added

- `basics/hello-solana/pinocchio` Rust + LiteSVM test (it previously had only a TypeScript test).

## [2026-04-08] - Quicknode fork modernization (Mike MacCana)

Mike MacCana led the Quicknode fork of the [Solana Foundation program examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples) from late 2025. The first commits on this repository lineage are dated **8 April 2026**; the summary below covers that work through the initial merge.

### What changed (high level)

**Toolchain and frameworks.** The tree had accumulated examples from several years of Solana development (including Anchor releases going back to the ~0.26 era in 2022 and many intermediate versions). The fork brought the Anchor examples up to **Anchor 1.0.0** stable (from 1.0.0-rc.5), refreshed Agave/Solana CLI pins, standardized on **pnpm**, and added parallel implementations in **[Quasar](https://quasar-lang.com/docs)**, **Pinocchio**, **Native Rust**, and **ASM** where applicable. Token-2022 examples were renamed to **`token-extensions`**.

**Testing.** Replaced the old pattern of local validators, Bankrun, and scattered TypeScript `anchor test` flows with **LiteSVM in-process tests** for most Anchor programs - matching current Anchor defaults (`cargo test` wired through `Anchor.toml` / `pnpm test`). Fixed broken or flaky tests across Native, Pinocchio, and Anchor; added missing harnesses (e.g. block-list Pinocchio). CI was reworked for a repo this size: path filtering, caching, matrix sharding, and reliable detection of framework roots.

**Programs and layout.** Broke large monolithic `lib.rs` files into **instruction handler modules**; adopted **`InitSpace`** and explicit PDA bumps instead of magic account sizes; corrected several logic bugs (escrow, token swap invariant, counter authority checks, compression Bubblegum program id, and more). Expanded finance and token-extension coverage; reorganized transfer-hook examples (including block-list under Pinocchio).

**Documentation.** Rewrote the root README (framework badges, clearer example blurbs, ASM links), ran a style and **truth audit** on READMEs, and linked canonical [Solana terminology](https://solana.com/docs/references/terminology) on first mention. Added this changelog, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (aligned with LiteSVM testing), README templates, per-example Anchor and Quasar READMEs, fixed Husky for GUI git clients, removed unused maintainer scripts (`sync-package-json`, `cicd.sh`, local-validator helpers for the allow/block-list UI), dropped the orphan `tokens/spl-token-minter/` tree, and removed legacy root `package.json` dependencies (web3.js, Bankrun, chai).

**Removed / deferred.** Dropped duplicate or WIP trees (duplicate block-list Pinocchio copy, Quasar metadata example blocked on `sol_realloc`, root `yarn.lock`). Some examples remain excluded from CI via `.ghaignore` until they build cleanly again (compression, escrow, pyth, and others - see that file for the live list).

## Before June 2026

There was **no changelog** before June 2026. Older history lives in git only.
