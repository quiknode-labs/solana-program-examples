# cnft-burn

> [!NOTE]
> This is the **Anchor v1** copy of this example, kept for programs staying on the
> Anchor v1 LTS line. Every `anchor` command on this page needs the v1 CLI:

> [`../anchor`](../anchor/).

An [Anchor](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#anchor) [program](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#program) that burns compressed NFTs (cNFTs) in your collection. The program performs a [CPI](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#cross-program-invocation-cpi) into the Metaplex Bubblegum program to do the burn.

## Components

- `programs/cnft-burn/` - the Anchor program.
- `migrations/` - deployment script.

## Testing

A Rust [LiteSVM](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/testing/litesvm) integration suite lives in `programs/cnft-burn/tests/`. It loads mainnet-dumped fixture binaries for Bubblegum, SPL Account Compression, and SPL Noop from `tests/fixtures/` (see the README there), so the CPIs run against the real programs in-process.

```bash
cargo build-sbf
cargo test
```

## Deployment

The program ID declared in [`programs/cnft-burn/src/lib.rs`](programs/cnft-burn/src/lib.rs) is `C6qxH8n6mZxrrbtMtYWYSp8JR8vkQ55X1o4EBg7twnMv`. Whether this address is currently deployed on any cluster is not tracked in this repo - verify with `solana program show <id>` against the cluster you care about.

To deploy your own copy, change the program ID in `lib.rs` and `Anchor.toml`, then run `anchor build && anchor deploy`.
