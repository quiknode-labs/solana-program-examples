# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering a contribution to this repository. We welcome new examples, fixes, and improvements from the community. For coding guidelines, see the [Quicknode Solana coding skill](https://github.com/quicknode/solana-claude-skill).

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history. This file had no changelog before June 2026.

## How to Contribute

- **Code:** Add new examples or improve existing ones (bug fixes, optimizations, additional features).
- **Bug reports, ideas, feedback:** Open an issue describing what you found or what you'd like to see.

## Project structure

- Each example lives at `category/example-name/<framework>/`, e.g. `basics/counter/anchor/`.
- Supported frameworks: `anchor`, `anchor-v1`, `quasar`, `pinocchio`, `native`, `asm`. Use the existing layout as a reference.
- `anchor/` is Anchor v2 (2.0.0-rc.1) and is where new Anchor work goes. `anchor-v1/` is the
  same example on Anchor v1 (1.2.0), kept for the v1 LTS line: it is a frozen snapshot and
  changes only to keep the v1 build green, not to gain new features.
- Anchor and Quasar programs usually keep Rust tests under `programs/<name>/tests/`.
- Native and Pinocchio tests are Rust + LiteSVM, kept under `program/tests/`.

## Tooling

- **Package manager:** `pnpm`. Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Do not use yarn or npm here. `pnpm` is used for repo-wide tooling (formatting, linting, git hooks) and for examples with JavaScript clients, not for running an example's tests.
- **Formatter / linter:** [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/). Run `pnpm fix` from the repo root before submitting a PR.

## Testing

Run an example's tests with the command for its framework, from the framework directory (e.g. `basics/counter/anchor/`):

- **Anchor v2** (in `anchor/`): `anchor test` (runs `cargo test`, per the `[scripts]` table in `Anchor.toml`), with the v2 CLI: `cargo install anchor-cli --version 2.0.0-rc.1 --locked`.
- **Anchor v1** (in `anchor-v1/`): the same `anchor test`, with the v1 CLI: `avm install 1.2.0 && avm use 1.2.0`. Selecting the wrong CLI is the usual cause of a confusing build failure in these directories.
- **Quasar:** `quasar test`.
- **Native / Pinocchio:** `cargo test --manifest-path=./program/Cargo.toml` (build first with `cargo build-sbf --manifest-path=./program/Cargo.toml`).

For an existing test pattern to follow, see `basics/counter/anchor/programs/counter_anchor/tests/test_counter.rs`.

### Native and Pinocchio

- Use LiteSVM for tests. Native, Pinocchio, and ASM examples are tested exclusively with Rust + LiteSVM; the old `@solana/web3.js` v1 / `solana-bankrun` / ts-mocha TypeScript suites were removed (see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)).
- The only remaining `@solana/web3.js` v1 usage is in a couple of wallet-adapter frontend demo apps under `tokens/token-extensions/`.

### ASM

ASM examples keep LiteSVM tests inline in `src/lib.rs`. Build with `sbpf build`, test with `cargo test`.

### TypeScript client tests (legacy / optional)

A few paths still use TypeScript with `node:test` and Codama-generated clients. That is not the default for new Anchor examples. Run with:

```bash
npx tsx --test --test-reporter=spec tests/*.ts
```

## Documentation

Every `anchor/` (and other framework) directory should include a `README.md`. Use [docs/example-readme-template.md](./docs/example-readme-template.md) as the starting point.

Also update [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) when you ship user-visible changes.

### Style

Write American English in prose (e.g. "behavior", "initialize", "favor"). Code identifiers stay as-is.

- One H1 per markdown file. Example READMEs title it `# Solana <Example> (<Framework>)`, e.g. `# Solana Escrow (Anchor)`.
- No em-dashes in prose. Use a colon, comma, or a new sentence.
- Fenced code blocks include a language tag (` ```rust `, ` ```typescript `, ` ```bash `, ` ```toml `).
- Link canonical Solana terms to the [terminology page](https://solana.com/docs/references/terminology) on first mention in READMEs.

## Excluding an example from CI

Add the project path to `.github/.ghaignore` with a one-line comment explaining why (build failure, needs mainnet fixtures, etc.). Remove entries when the example is fixed.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and inclusive. Constructive feedback only. Report any conduct issues to the maintainers.
