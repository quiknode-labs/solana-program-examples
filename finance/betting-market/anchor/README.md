A parimutuel (pooled) betting market on Solana. An admin opens an **event**, adds the possible
**outcomes**, and bettors stake a token on the outcome they think will win. Every stake across
every outcome goes into one pool. When the admin settles the event to the winning outcome, the
losing stakes - minus a protocol fee - are split among the winners in proportion to their stake.

This is the pooled model used by Solana prediction-market platforms such as Hedgehog Markets,
where odds are set by the crowd's stakes rather than by an order book or a fixed-odds bookmaker.

## Purpose

It solves the core custody problem of pooled betting: collecting stakes from many bettors, holding
them in one place no single bettor controls, and paying winners by a fixed, public formula. Resolution
still requires trusting the admin, who chooses the winning outcome, as described below. The pool is
a token account owned by the event's PDA, so payouts are signed by the program with the event's
seeds - there is no admin key that can move bettors' stakes out of the pool. The admin's only
powers are creating events/outcomes and choosing the winning outcome (or cancelling).

## Major Concepts

### Accounts

- **Config** (`seeds = [b"config"]`) - one per deployment. Holds the `admin` (the only key that can
  create events/outcomes, settle, and cancel), the `token_mint` every market accepts, the
  `fee_recipient`, and the `default_fee_bps` each new event copies at creation.
- **Event** (`seeds = [b"event", event_id]`) - one betting market. Tracks `total_pool`, `status`
  (`Open` / `Settled` / `Cancelled`), and - once settled - the `winning_outcome_index`,
  `winning_pool`, and `distributable_losing_pool` that the payout formula reads. The event's
  `fee_bps` is copied from the config's `default_fee_bps` at creation and is what settlement
  charges, so later Config changes can't alter a market bettors have already joined.
- **Outcome** (`seeds = [b"outcome", event, index]`) - one possible result. Its `total_amount` is
  the outcome's share of the pool and the denominator for pro-rata payouts when it wins.
- **Bet** (`seeds = [b"bet", outcome, bettor]`) - a bettor's total stake on one outcome. Re-betting
  the same outcome adds to the existing Bet, so there is exactly one per (outcome, bettor). The
  account exists only while the position is open: it closes (rent back to the bettor) via
  `claim_winnings`, `claim_refund`, or `close_losing_bet`, which is also what makes a second claim
  impossible.
- **User** (`seeds = [b"user", wallet]`) - a per-wallet index listing the bettor's open Bet
  addresses, so a client can find someone's positions without scanning every Bet on the program.
  `place_bet` adds an entry and every instruction that closes a Bet removes it, so the cap (see
  `MAX_BETS_PER_USER`) limits concurrent open positions, not lifetime bets. The fixed cap keeps the
  account a constant size; the Bet accounts are the authoritative stake record.

### The vault

Each event owns a single vault token account - the associated token account of the Event PDA for
`config.token_mint`. `place_bet` moves the stake from the bettor's token account into this vault.
`settle_event`, `claim_winnings`, and `claim_refund` move tokens back out, with the program signing
as the Event PDA (`seeds = [b"event", event_id, bump]`).

### Payout formula

When an event settles to a winning outcome:

```
losing_pool             = total_pool - winning_pool
fee                     = losing_pool * fee_bps / 10000      // charged only on the losing side
distributable_losing    = losing_pool - fee
```

Each winning bet then claims:

```
payout = stake + stake * distributable_losing / winning_pool
```

A winner always gets their own stake back; the fee is only ever taken from losing stakes. Integer
division floors each share, leaving at most a few minor units of dust in the vault.

**Example:** Outcome A pool 100, Outcome B pool 50, `fee_bps = 200` (2%). A wins.
`losing_pool = 50`, `fee = 1`, `distributable_losing = 49`. A bettor who staked 40 claims
`40 + 40 * 49 / 100 = 59`.

### Instruction handlers

- `initialize_config` - anyone (the signer becomes admin). One-time setup: sets admin, stake
  token, default fee, fee recipient.
- `initialize_event` - admin. Opens a market and creates its vault.
- `add_outcome` - admin. Adds a possible result. Only before any bet is placed.
- `place_bet` - bettor. Stakes tokens on one outcome; updates the pools and adds the Bet to the
  user's index (rejected with `TooManyBets` if all `MAX_BETS_PER_USER` slots hold open positions).
- `settle_event` - admin. Resolves to a winning outcome, takes the fee, records the payout figures.
- `claim_winnings` - winning bettor. Withdraws stake plus pro-rata share of the losing pool, then
  closes the Bet account and removes it from the user's index.
- `close_losing_bet` - losing bettor. After settlement, closes a worthless Bet to reclaim its rent
  and free the slot in the user's index.
- `cancel_event` - admin. Voids an unresolved market.
- `claim_refund` - bettor. After a cancellation, reclaims the exact stake; the Bet account closes
  and leaves the user's index.

`add_outcome` is locked once betting starts, so the field of choices can't change under existing
bettors. `settle_event` rejects a winning outcome with no bets - use `cancel_event` to unwind an
event that can't be resolved fairly.

## Setup

Install the [Solana CLI](https://docs.anza.xyz/cli/install) (provides `cargo-build-sbf`) and
[Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation). Build the program so the test binary
exists on disk:

```sh
anchor build
```

## Testing

Tests are Rust integration tests running against [LiteSVM](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/testing/litesvm)
with [solana-kite](https://crates.io/crates/solana-kite) helpers. They cover the full lifecycle
(bet → settle → claim with exact payout and fee assertions), admin authorization, the
bet-after-settle and double-claim guards, settling an outcome with no bets, the cancel/refund
path, the `close_losing_bet` guards, and the User index: claims, refunds, and losing-bet closes
remove the Bet's entry, and a wallet whose index is full can bet again after closing a position.

```sh
anchor test
```

(`Anchor.toml` sets `test = "cargo test"`, so `cargo test` works too.)

## FAQ

### How does a prediction market work on Solana?

This example uses the parimutuel (pooled) model: an admin opens an event with `initialize_event` and `add_outcome`, and bettors stake tokens on an outcome with `place_bet`. Every stake goes into one pool; after `settle_event` names the winning outcome, winners call `claim_winnings` to split the losing stakes, minus a protocol fee, in proportion to their own stake.

### How are the odds set?

By the crowd, not a bookmaker: each winner's payout scales with their share of the winning pool, so the implied odds shift as stakes arrive. This is the model used by Solana prediction-market platforms such as Hedgehog Markets and by racetrack tote boards.

### What happens if an event is cancelled?

The admin calls `cancel_event` and every bettor reclaims their full stake with `claim_refund`. After a settled event, losers reclaim their bet account's rent with `close_losing_bet`.
