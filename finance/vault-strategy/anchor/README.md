A manager-run investment vault on Solana. Users deposit [USDC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usd-coin-usdc.asp) and receive shares representing proportional ownership of a portfolio of assets. The manager adds assets a curator has approved and sets their target weights; each deposit is deployed across those assets at its weights in the same transaction. The manager rebalances as prices drift, earns a fee, and depositors withdraw their proportional slice in kind when they choose.

The example uses two stocks as the portfolio assets: **TSLAx** (Tesla) and **NVDAx** (NVIDIA) - [xStocks](https://backed.fi/xstocks) issued on Solana by Backed Finance. In tests these are mock [tokens](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#token).

A note on the word **vault**: by the common standard (ERC-4626) a vault holds a single asset. Here a vault is one single-asset [token account](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#token-account), and the whole multi-asset construct is the **strategy**, which owns one vault per asset plus a USDC vault. So "vault strategy" reads literally: a strategy built from vaults.

## Programs

- **`vault-strategy`**: Registry and approved assets, strategy creation, asset registration, deposits, share minting, fee accrual, rebalancing, withdrawals
- **`mock-swap-router`**: Test-only fake Jupiter. Stores exchange rates, mints/burns basket tokens for USDC. Replaced by real [Jupiter](https://jup.ag) in production.

## Key Financial Concepts

### Net Asset Value (NAV)

[NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp) is the total value of everything the strategy holds: the USDC vault balance plus each asset vault balance valued at its Pyth price. It prices new deposits fairly, so every depositor pays the same per-share price regardless of when they join.

Because the asset set is dynamic, `deposit` must value *every* asset. The assets live at PDAs indexed `0..asset_count`, and `deposit` re-derives that complete range from the accounts it is given, refusing to run if any asset is missing (`IncompleteAssetAccounts`). This makes it structurally impossible to omit an asset and understate NAV.

Referencing every asset has a transaction-size cost: `deposit` pulls in `14 + 5N` accounts and `withdraw` `10 + 4N`, where `N` is the asset count. That stays within Solana's 128-account transaction lock limit at the `MAX_ASSETS` cap of 16 (94 accounts for `deposit`), but a basket beyond roughly three assets no longer fits a legacy transaction's 1232-byte limit, so the client must send a v0 transaction with an [Address Lookup Table](https://docs.anza.xyz/proposals/versioned-transactions).

Prices come from [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) `PriceUpdateV2` accounts. A 60-second staleness window is enforced; zero or negative prices are rejected.

### Shares

A [share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shares.asp) represents a fraction of the whole strategy. Hold 1% of shares and you own 1% of every vault.

- **Every deposit**, the first included: `shares_to_mint = deposit_usdc × (total_shares + VIRTUAL_SHARES) / (NAV + VIRTUAL_ASSETS)`, floored.
- **The virtual offset** is the defense against the first-depositor inflation attack. `VIRTUAL_SHARES` is 1,000 (`10^SHARE_DECIMALS_OFFSET`) and `VIRTUAL_ASSETS` is one USDC minor unit, so an empty strategy already has a share price and there is no special case for the first deposit. The share mint has `SHARE_DECIMALS` = 9 decimals, USDC's six plus the offset of three, so one whole share still tracks one USDC at launch: a 900 USDC first deposit mints 900,000,000,000 share minor units, which reads as 900 shares.
- **Why it is safe**: tokens sent straight to a vault count as fund value the moment they arrive, so without the offset a dust first deposit followed by a donation could price one share above the next deposit, which would floor to zero shares. With it, a deposit floors to zero only when the strategy already holds more than a thousand times it, and a donation is split between the real shares and the virtual ones, so an attacker loses about a thousand times what the next depositor loses. Deposit one minor unit, donate 1,000 USDC, and a following 1,000 USDC deposit still mints 1,999 share minor units that redeem for about 999.75 USDC; the attacker's 1,000 share minor units redeem for about 500 USDC. Pinned by `test_donation_does_not_inflate_share_price`.
- **Withdrawals** pay `vault_balance × shares / (total_shares + VIRTUAL_SHARES)` per vault, floored, so the virtual shares' slice of every vault (at most 1,000 parts in `total_shares` + 1,000) is never paid out.
- Shares are [SPL tokens](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#token); the share mint's address is a [PDA](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#program-derived-address-pda), so it is deterministic and the strategy PDA is its mint authority.

### Management Fee

A [management fee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/managementfee.asp), in [basis points](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) (100 bps = 1% per year), is charged by *minting new shares to the manager*, diluting holders proportionally. This is the common onchain pattern (Yearn, Lido charge fees this way) and differs from a traditional fund, which deducts the fee in cash from assets.

```
fee_shares = total_shares × fee_bps × elapsed_seconds / (10_000 × 31_536_000)
```

The fee dilutes the real supply only: the virtual shares hold nothing of anyone's and earn the manager nothing. `collect_fees` is permissionless. The fee is fixed at creation and capped at `MAX_FEE_BPS` (1,000 bps = 10%); there is no setter to raise it later.

### Weights and Rebalancing

Each asset carries a target **weight** in basis points (e.g. 40% TSLAx, 60% NVDAx). A strategy accepts deposits only once its weights sum to exactly 10,000 (`add_asset` and `set_weight` keep the running sum at or below 10,000; `deposit` requires it to equal 10,000, else `StrategyNotFullyAllocated`). So a strategy is either still being configured or fully allocated and live, and `deposit` deploys each depositor's USDC straight into the basket at those weights, fully invested bar sub-cent rounding dust. There is no idle-cash mode.

[Rebalancing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) handles the drift that prices create after a deposit: `rebalance` sells an over-weight asset for USDC and buys an under-weight one in a single atomic instruction. `set_weight` changes a target after creation, including setting it to zero to **retire** an asset: deposits stop allocating to it, the manager sells its holdings out with `rebalance`, and the now-empty vault keeps its index so the contiguous `0..asset_count` range stays intact (the index is never reused).

### Slippage, bounded by the oracle

[Slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) is the gap between the expected and the realized amount of a swap. Rather than trust a manager-supplied minimum, `deposit` and `rebalance` compute the floor themselves from the Pyth price and the strategy's `max_slippage_bps`: a swap whose output falls more than that tolerance below the oracle-implied amount reverts. `max_slippage_bps` is set at creation and capped at `MAX_SLIPPAGE_BPS` (1,000 bps = 10%).

### In-Kind Withdrawal

An [in-kind distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/in-kind.asp) returns the underlying assets, not cash. `withdraw` burns shares and pays out a proportional slice of the USDC vault and every asset vault. The user must already hold a token account for each asset; you can sell those on a DEX yourself.

## Program Flow

### Participants

- **Victor**, the registry authority: curates which assets, and which official Pyth feed, are safe to hold. A protocol role, not a manager.
- **Maria**, the strategy manager: earns a 1% annual fee running a basket she has a thesis on.
- **Alice**, the early depositor: wants diversified TSLAx and NVDAx exposure without managing positions.
- **Bob**, the later depositor: joins the same strategy after it has been running.

`Maria` and `Victor` are stored as plain `Pubkey`s and may each be a [Squads](https://squads.so/) multisig; the program only checks the signature.

### Victor creates the registry and approves assets

`initialize_registry()` creates a `Registry` PDA (`["registry", victor]`) owned by Victor. The registry holds no list; it only names the curator. The approved set is the collection of `ApprovedAsset` accounts under it: `approve_asset(price_feed)` creates one `ApprovedAsset` PDA (`["approved_asset", registry, mint]`) per approved mint, binding it to its official Pyth feed, and an asset counts as approved exactly when that account exists. Only Victor can create them. This separation is the anti-fraud core: a manager can only ever add assets Victor approved, and the feed comes from the registry, so a manager cannot list a token they mint themselves or pair a real mint with a feed they control.

### Maria initializes the strategy

`initialize_strategy(index=0, fee_bps=100, max_slippage_bps=100, swap_router)` creates the `Strategy` PDA (`["strategy", 0]`), the share mint, and the USDC vault, binding the strategy to Victor's registry. The strategy is addressed by a caller-chosen index (`"strategy" + 0`, `"strategy" + 1`, …) rather than the manager's key. No assets yet.

### Maria adds assets

`add_asset(weight_bps)`, once per asset, creates an `AssetConfig` at `["asset", strategy, index]` (index = current `asset_count`), copies the official feed from the ApprovedAsset account, and creates that asset's vault. TSLAx at index 0 (4000 bps), NVDAx at index 1 (6000 bps). Rejected if the mint is not approved (its ApprovedAsset account does not exist), if the weights would exceed 10,000 bps, or once `MAX_ASSETS` (16) is reached. Deposits stay closed until the weights sum to exactly 10,000.

### Alice deposits, and her money is deployed at once

`deposit(usdc_amount, minimum_shares)`, with each asset's `[asset_config, vault, mint, rate, price_feed]` passed as remaining accounts, plus the router accounts. The handler requires the strategy to be fully allocated, values every asset for NAV, prices her shares with the virtual offset (900 USDC into the empty strategy mints 900 whole shares), mints them to Alice, then deploys her USDC across the basket at its target weights through the router, each leg under an oracle slippage floor. With the weights at 40/60, a 900 USDC deposit lands as 1.44 TSLAx and 3.0 NVDAx with no idle USDC.

### Bob deposits at the current share price

Same as Alice's deposit. Because shares are priced at NAV, Bob pays the current per-share value and does not dilute Alice's gain; his USDC is deployed at the target weights too.

### Maria rebalances

A price move pushes the basket off target. `rebalance(sell_amount, usdc_to_invest)` sells the over-weight asset for USDC and buys the under-weight one, both legs bounded against their Pyth prices, in one atomic instruction. `set_weight(weight_bps)` changes a target between rebalances, or retires an asset by setting it to zero (then reassign that weight to another asset to reach 100% again, and `rebalance` liquidates the retired holdings).

### Fees accrue

`collect_fees()` mints time-and-rate-proportional fee shares to Maria, diluting all holders by the fee.

### Alice withdraws in kind

`withdraw(shares_to_burn, min_usdc_out)`, with each asset's `[asset_config, vault, mint, user_token_account]` as remaining accounts. Alice's shares burn and she receives her proportional slice of USDC and every asset. Amounts floor in the protocol's favour.

## Oracle Integration (Pyth)

`PriceUpdateV2` price (i64) is read at byte offset 73 and `publish_time` at 93, directly from account bytes to avoid borsh version incompatibility with Anchor. Pyth USD pairs use exponent −8; with USDC and the basket tokens all at 6 decimals, value in USDC minor units is `amount × price / 10⁸`. Each asset's feed pubkey is fixed in its `AssetConfig` (copied from the registry), and validated on every read. In tests, mock `PriceUpdateV2` accounts are injected into LiteSVM (TSLAx $250, NVDAx $180).

---

## Mock Swap Router vs Production

The `mock-swap-router` exists only for testing: it stores a `usdc_per_token` rate per asset, holds the basket mints' authority, and mints/burns to simulate swaps. The `Strategy` stores the router program pubkey at creation, and `deposit` and `rebalance` require the router account to match it (`InvalidSwapRouter`). In production, replace the router CPIs with [Jupiter](https://jup.ag); the strategy PDA still signs.

---

## What restricts the manager

The strategy PDA holds all assets; no instruction moves a vault's tokens to the manager. The manager's powers are fenced:

- **Assets** are limited to mints approved by the registry authority, with the price feed taken from the registry, not the manager.
- **Swaps** go only through the one router registered at creation, and each leg's minimum output is computed from the oracle, not supplied by the manager.
- **The fee** is fixed at creation and capped at 10%, paid only in minted shares.

What remains to trust: the honesty of the registered router and registry. With an honest router, the worst a careless manager can do is churn and pay market slippage (which hurts depositors but does not enrich the manager); the manager cannot withdraw principal.

---

## Financial Math Implementation

- Integer arithmetic only; intermediate products use `u128`; multiply before divide.
- All arithmetic uses `checked_*`. Users receive floor division; the protocol keeps the remainder.
- `transfer_checked` carries decimals through every token CPI.

## Build and Test

```bash
# Build each program on its own. Building the whole workspace at once unifies the
# vault's `cpi` feature into the router build and strips the router's entrypoint,
# leaving a stub .so, so build per-manifest (as `anchor build` does):
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/mock-swap-router/Cargo.toml
cargo build-sbf --manifest-path programs/vault-strategy/Cargo.toml

# Run tests (LiteSVM, no local validator needed)
cargo test --manifest-path programs/vault-strategy/Cargo.toml
```

Tests live in `programs/vault-strategy/tests/vault_strategy.rs` and use [LiteSVM](https://github.com/LiteSVM/litesvm). Both `.so` files are loaded from `target/deploy/`, so build before testing. The suite covers the full lifecycle end to end (deposit with auto-deployment, a price move, rebalance back to target, a second depositor priced at the new NAV, a year's fee, in-kind withdrawal), retiring an asset with `set_weight` and reallocating to reopen deposits, and the rejection paths: unapproved asset, weight overflow, over-cap fee and slippage, oracle-bounded deposit slippage, an under-allocated strategy, non-manager `set_weight`, unregistered router, and incomplete asset accounts on deposit. `test_donation_does_not_inflate_share_price` runs the first-depositor inflation attack (a one-minor-unit deposit, a 1,000 USDC donation straight into the USDC vault, then a 1,000 USDC deposit with no `minimum_shares` floor) and checks that the victim's shares are nonzero and redeem for all but a fraction of a dollar while the attacker loses about a thousand times as much.

## FAQ

### How do I build an onchain investment fund on Solana?

A manager creates a strategy with `initialize_strategy`, registers curator-approved assets with `add_asset` at target weights, and investors `deposit` USDC for shares. Each deposit is deployed across the basket in the same transaction, and `withdraw` redeems a proportional slice of every vault in kind.

### How are share prices calculated?

Shares are priced at the strategy's net asset value: the total value of the vault balances at current prices, plus one virtual minor unit, divided by shares outstanding plus 1,000 virtual shares. A later depositor pays the current share price rather than diluting earlier ones, and the virtual offset keeps the price defined and the first depositor honest when the strategy is empty.

### How does the manager operate the fund?

`rebalance` trades the vaults back to their target weights as prices drift, `set_weight` reweights or retires an asset, and a management fee accrues over time and is collected with `collect_fees`.
