# Changelog

## 2026-09-08

Move to Anchor 1.2.0, LiteSVM 0.16.0 and solana-kite 0.5.0. No program source
changed. `test_swap_rejects_stale_price` used to warp to an absolute slot;
LiteSVM now starts its clock at a mainnet-like slot rather than zero, so that
warp moved time backwards and the price never went stale. It now warps
relative to the current slot, as the other tests already did.

## 2026-08-04

Reject oracle prices from before a cluster restart. A halt stops the slot
count but not the wall clock, so after a restart a feed can look fresh in
slots while its price is hours old; for a market maker that is a free option
for whoever trades first. `read_oracle_price` now also requires the feed's
slot to be after the `LastRestartSlot` sysvar's slot
(`PricePredatesRestart`). Tested by
`test_swap_rejects_price_from_before_a_restart`.

## 2026-07-11 (later)

Retuned the walkthrough trade to 5 NVDAx (825.825 USDC at the ask,
824.175 back at the bid, 1.65 round-trip spread) so the numbers match the
book's convention that every character starts with 1,000 USDC. Same math,
same gates; only the amounts changed.

## 2026-07-11

Initial version: an oracle-quoted proprietary AMM. One operator funds the
market's inventory and quotes both sides of it at the oracle price plus a
spread; anyone can swap against the quotes. Includes the `mock-switchboard`
oracle program for deterministic tests.
