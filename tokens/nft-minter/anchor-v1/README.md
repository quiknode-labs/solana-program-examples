# NFT Minter (Anchor)

> [!NOTE]
> This is the **Anchor v1** copy of this example, kept for programs staying on the
> Anchor v1 LTS line. Every `anchor` command on this page needs the v1 CLI:
> `avm install 1.2.0 && avm use 1.2.0`. The Anchor v2 version of this example is in
> [`../anchor`](../anchor/).

Mint an NFT from inside your program using the Classic Token Program and Metaplex Token Metadata.

See also: [Nft Minter overview](../README.md) and the [repository catalog](../../../README.md).

## Major concepts

- NFT mint with 0 decimals
- Metadata CPI

## Setup

From this directory (`tokens/nft-minter/anchor/`):

```bash
anchor build
```

Prerequisites: [Agave](https://docs.anza.xyz/) CLI (version in `Anchor.toml` `[toolchain]`), [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs).

## Testing

Tests run in-process with [LiteSVM](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/testing/litesvm). No local validator.

```bash
anchor test
```

This runs `cargo test` as configured in `Anchor.toml`. Tests call instruction handlers and check onchain state.

## Usage

Read the program `programs/` source and `Anchor.toml` for deployed program IDs. For deployment, use `anchor build && anchor deploy` against your target cluster.
